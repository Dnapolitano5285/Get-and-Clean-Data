The data for this data set and accompanying script were taken from the below study:

The data was originally collected in the below fashion:
=======================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Summary choices:
================

As per instructions when the data of the test and trainig subjects was combined I filtered out all columns that do not 
contain data related to the mean or standard deviation of a measurement. This was accomplished by searching all column headings
and finding the index of all that matched. I created a new data table that left out the columns we were uninterested in. 

The variable names were maintained from the original data set due to their specificity and all data contained in the outputted file
represents the mean of said measurement. Changing the variable names that were given by the original data set would 
require making them more convoluted as the compressed description was apt and provided what item, force and direction 
was being measured. I added a variable title for subject and activity to enhance clarity of what participant and activity was
being measured. I set the subject and activity to factor variables to allow for easy grouping and analysis. Despite being
asked to only provide a mean, by createing factors we can further analysis on a number of levels by subject and activity with
ease. 

I choose to include any variable that contained the mean or standard deviation despite some appearing to be highly similar. 
I felt it was more important to have a wider breadth of data than fewer variables and need one after the analysis was run. 
A user of this script can easily filter out a column of a mean or standard deviation that I left in if they did not want it. 
 
 
As provided by the original study, the description of variables is contained below:
===================================================================================
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value 
std(): Standard deviation 
mad(): Median absolute deviation  
max(): Largest value in array 
min(): Smallest value in array 
sma(): Signal magnitude area 
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.  
iqr(): Interquartile range  
entropy(): Signal entropy 
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals 
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude 
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency 
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal  
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal  
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. 
angle(): Angle between to vectors. 

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean 
tBodyAccMean 
tBodyAccJerkMean 
tBodyGyroMean 
tBodyGyroJerkMean
